Changed made in github remote repo
Here are some of the other git commands that are important from an exam perspective

1. Git gc command - This is a command that is used for maintenance purposes. The gc command is a garbage collection command and is used to clean up the git repository.

If you also use the --aggressive flag along with the command, it will also try to save more disk space after the completion.

Below is an example output from the command


2. git prune command - This command is used to clean up unreachable or orphaned objects. So you can run the git prune command after the git gc command
